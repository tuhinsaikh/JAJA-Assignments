/*
	 Create a class Employee as Java Bean class with the following private member
	variables.
	int employeeId
	String employeeName
	double salary
	double netSalary
	
	Write the following method in the Employee class: public void calculateNetSalary(int
	pfpercentage)  - This method should take PF percentage as argument. Deduct the PF
	amount from the salary and set the netSalary
	
	Create a Main class which has the main method which invokes the method to get the
	input and prints the details as shown in the sample.
	
	Also write a method :
	public static Employee getEmployeeDetails() -  which gets the employee details - id,
	name and salary from the user and returns the employee object.
	
	public static int getPFPercentage() -  which gets the PF percentage and returns the
	same
	
	In the main method invoke the above two methods, and then call the calculateNetSalary
	method in Employee class and print the output as shown below.
	
	Sample Input 1:
	Enter Id: 101 Enter Name: Vivek Enter salary: 20000 Enter PF percentage: 7
	Sample Output 1:
	Id : 101
	Name : Vivek
	Salary : 20000.0
	Net Salary : 18600.0
